# Block 28, React Router Workshop
Build a simple application that navigates between two routes /blue and /red to render a simple component with the background being that specific color. 

## Requirements
Utilize the components from React Router to build out our functionality. There are no hooks for this workshop.

There are four tabs below:<br/> 
Initialize the vite project and install the node modules<br/>
Configure React Router, install react-router-dom, and import routes to App.jsx<br/>
Navbar and the Link component to Red, Blue, and Home pages<br/>
